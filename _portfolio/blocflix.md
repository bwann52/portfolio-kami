## Explanation

The explanation of a case study will describe the backstory of the project, the key players (featuring both users and stakeholders), your relationship with the project, and what roles you played.


## Problem

The problem is what you were hired to solve. This usually lists the reasons why you were brought on board and the issues you were given to resolve. Once you establish the list of problems, you can further expand on each and how they relate to the project you're working on.

If you're working on an existing web site or application, you can display old screenshots or artifacts of the project prior to the work you completed.


## Solution

You should discuss your solutions and back your decisions up with conducted research. You can explain the solution to each problem separately. Provide reasoning that supports the fixes you proposed. You should also display screenshots or artifacts of your presented solutions. Include all assets created in the design or development process. Explain your work and the theory behind it.

If you are working on an existing web site or application, you should show a comparison of the old and new. Discuss how your solution corrects a problem found in the former.


## Results

Testing is a big part of the design and development process. Understanding whether or not your solutions worked is essential. Provide information about your testing process then share the results you discovered from your users.

For design projects, if you have testimonials or quotes from those you interviewed and tested with, you can share those within the case study. Stakeholder interviews can also help validate your solutions, if they pertain to the business side of design.

## Conclusion

After sharing your solutions, you should summarize your final thoughts on the project. Ask yourself the following:

* What worked?
* What didn't?
* What were your doubts going into the project?
* What surprised you the most?
* What would you have done differently?
* What did you learn while doing this project?
* How will you use that information in the future?

This list of questions can help you analyze the project's success, the process you went through to complete it, and what changes you may make to your process for future projects.

Case studies can either be long-form or short-form. Long-form case studies are time consuming, but examine every detail of your involvement in a project. Short-form case studies can provide insight into your process, but keep the information short and concise.

Typically, professionals present case studies in a portfolio. You can also create a presentable PDF or text document to share.
